Part of the Rift Valley Platform
--------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
============
ANDISOL is the "public face" of the lowest levels of the Rift Valley Platform. It encapsulates the model (database or server connections), and provides an object-based, functional model to the implementation layers.

You use it by instantiating an instance of ANDISOL, after setting up a valid database configuration.
